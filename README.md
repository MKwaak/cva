## SSR

T.b.d.

## Development

To start developing your application run `yarn dev`. This starts the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.

## Scientific papers (Articles)

The scientific papers are stored in a [knowledge graph](https://www.semi.technology/documentation/weaviate/current/about/philosophy.html). The tool used is [Weaviate](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate). 

To run the Weaviate change the directory in your terminal to `./weavite`, and run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Once the download (+/- 1.6 GB) of the instance is done, your local Weaviate instance will install. This might take a while. Once it's done you can run it on `http://localhost:8080/v1/meta`.
