## Building a production build

To start this application first build the client:

```bash
$ docker-compose build --no-cache

# run all the services
$ docker-compose up
```

_Note: Once the download (+/- 1.6 GB) of the instance is done, your local Weaviate instance will install. This might take a while. Once it's done you can run it on `http://localhost:8080/v1/meta`._
_Note: also anytime the config, data or client changes re-run previous command in the corresponding directory_

Now you can open the client in the browser window by opening `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## Development

- User Interface: `./client`
- Server (for Mailchimp subscription): `./server`
- Articles (Weaviate): `./weaviate`

## Deployment

Deployment is managed via Github. Once a push has been done an automated task will deploy this project. A typical deployment will take about +/- 15 mins.

Bug: Occasionally the build will fail. One example is that the disk space is full. (json.log: no space left on device). Since this is managed elsewhere this repo has no control over this and will not be notified...
