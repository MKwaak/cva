              <Typography gutterBottom>
                A value creation mindset drives thought processes and actions that are needed to
                realize purposeful, sustainable and prosperous societies, companies, institutions,
                NGO’s, and think-tanks. It provides a wider and more meaningful view of complex
                problems to solve than the yet important but fragmented and narrow expert views.
                For companies this is a key to increased profitability – but a profitability with
                awareness and understanding of the underpinning long-term factors. For
                non-commercial organizations it is a key to higher societal impact and appreciation.
