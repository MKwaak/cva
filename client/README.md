- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Javascript that scales

## SSR

T.b.d.

## Development

To start developing your application run `yarn dev`. This starts the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.

Note: This will not start a Weaviate instance which you will need for the Article page.

## Dev Deployment

[Zeit](https://zeit.co/) is used to quickly be able to deploy a new visual style of the website for user acceptance testing. 

This will be removed in the future and replaced for a deploy on a development server using the Docker setup.
