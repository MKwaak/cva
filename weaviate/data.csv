This article focuses on the need for organizations to align the promises that they are making while communicating the benefits of their brand with their current and potential customers, with the actual delivery of that promise. The benefits of such an alignment will result in stronger brand equity, greater customer centricity, increased levels of loyalty and concrete differentiation in the marketplace. The article begins with a review of the current situation of ‘on brand’ service gauging some of the reasons as to why delivery is not aligned with the promises made by the brand, and showcases some success stories. The article then discusses a tool that provides organizations with the ability to translate the brand promise into service delivery at every customer interaction resulting in authentic and memorable ‘moments-of-truth’ for the customer. This article is based on the author's experiences, observations, empirical evidence, and formal and informal discussions with his clients and non-clients."

The success rate of such new products directly influences a retailer's success in terms of gross profit, customer loyalty and brand image. In the past decades, many self-report and focus group based methods were implemented to gain insights in future market performance of new products. However, social psychology and market research studies have established that self-reports are unreliable to accurately predict customer preference. In this article, we propose a novel approach based on brain data to forecast product performance and discuss the importance of pre-market forecasting in the footwear retailing industry. We implemented and validated the tool in collaboration with a European shoe store chain. This case study showed that self-report based methods cannot accurately foretell success, while using brain data the prediction accuracy reached 80 per cent. We also compared how these two different methods might influence company gross profit. Simulations based on sales data showed that self-report based prediction would lead to a 12.1 per cent profit growth, while brain scan based prediction would increase profit by 36.4 per cent. Thus, this innovative neuroscientific approach greatly improves brand image and brings considerable value for organizations, shareholders as well as consumers."

In each of these respective capacities, service ( S ) processes, relationship ( R ) processes and loyalty ( L ) processes create value for both customers and organizations. Satisfactory service is the minimum requirement for relationship processes to be effective and for the connection capacity to be activated. Likewise, high relationship quality is a minimal condition for loyalty processes to be effective and for the resource capacity to be activated. After presenting the measurable and actionable dimensions of relationship quality, I explain the difference between service processes and relationship processes. According to the service integrated relationships (SIR) framework, when relationship processes are integrated with existing service processes: ( a ) relationship quality improves; ( b ) loyal customer behaviours are evoked; and ( c ) service satisfaction improves. I conclude by discussing implications of the SIR framework for organizational systems and service employees."

One reason for the delay is the lack of a blueprint as to how to do it, and what it entails. This article seeks to remedy that problem by laying out the steps for the creation of the Chief Customer Feedback Officer (CCFO), the nine different functions his office is entrusted with, and how they create value for the organization by providing a customer compass for the strategic direction of the organization. Some of the nine functions currently exist in the organization but are out of place and cannot influence the strategic direction of the organization. It is only by implementing all nine functions with the backing of top management that an organization can successfully become customer-centric, creating value for all of its stakeholders."

Groundbreaking Research from the Early Days of Customer Value Management","During the early 1980s, if one were to research the expressions, value management or value creation at your local library, 99 per cent of the articles and books would be on shareholder value. The only reference to customer value would be advertising articles that promised ‘new improved value’, marketing hype for consumer goods, such as larger sized laundry detergent boxes. Shareholder value management had 100 years of art and science for measuring and managing financials complete with standards and guidelines and government-mandated reporting rules and regulations. There were none to help businesses measure, manage or create customer value. Michael Porter from Harvard University just published his book on competitive strategy stating you can compete on quality or price, pick your competitive strategy. The early days of the world-wide quality revolution was in full swing. Quality was designed by engineers and measured by quality experts in the firm. If you asked anyone what the purpose of a business was the answer would be ‘to make money’ or ‘to create value for the shareholde’. But global competition was increasing. Customer choice was exploding. The customer was flexing his or her power of choice and voting not for either the best quality or the best price, but for both. They wanted the best value. Quality now would be measured by the customer perceptions in the marketplace not engineers or quality-control experts. Goodness of price would be determined by the marketplace. The resulting perceived value of goods and services would be judged by the customer. The real purpose of a business was becoming clear, to improve the quality of life and create value for the customers. Firms that did it best would thrive and survive. To win, business managers needed new concepts, tools and methods for creating and managing customer value. The following article is a 1989 paper that reported on some of the most significant findings in the early days of customer value measurement and management. It is based on one of the largest empirical data bases available at that time. AT&T was doing over 60,000 customer surveys per month. Three years of monthly findings were analyzed by some of the best researchers and scientists in the 300k employee and $85 billion annual revenue company. The paper presented empirical evidence of the power of the consumer's perception of customer value, its impact on market share, growth and customer loyalty and ultimately its impact on shareholder value and employee value. The paper was never published, but it was released throughout AT&T and also to AT&T's strategic business partners. Its content was presented and discussed at national conferences hosted by the American Marketing Association and the US Conference Board. Its findings have stood the test of time. It is published here for the first time. It is important to note that today AT&T is a completely different company from then in 1989. Since then the company split into three separate businesses, AT&T, Lucent and NCR. The portion of the business that kept the name later merged with another communications company."

The key to sustainable business success is the generation of significant value for the customer, as it is the customers that generate the margins upon which retailers' sustainable operations depends. By definition, when value is created for customers, value for the business follows. In an empirical study, we quantitatively investigate the value creation capability of some of the largest food and fashion retailers worldwide on the basis of two financial ratios, that is, their q-ratio and their long-term revenue growth. In a subsequent qualitative analysis, the business strategies of firms with higher and lower value creation capabilities are compared with the objective to identify success factors for value creation. In food retailing, formats that employ discounting strategies and backward integration strategies are among the more successful strategic approaches. Apparently, these approaches are superior in creating significant value for the customer. In fashion retailing, backward integration and fast-fashion strategies turn out to be leading to superior value propositions."

This is because the cornerstone framework of measuring and improving a value exchange applies to all sorts of decisions. We present a case study in which Customer Value Management techniques were used to analyze the value of a particular community through the perspective of entrepreneurs themselves, allowing us to uncover how entrepreneurs decide whether it is ‘worth it’ to start a business in their community. We also demonstrate a strong link between the value perceived by entrepreneurs and their loyalty to the community, showing ‘how good is good’ when it comes to enticing entrepreneurs to engage with and promote the local startup ecosystem. This case study offers a framework that can be used by community leaders to manage the value exchange with members and constituents in the community. Once leaders better understand the value proposition that drives decisions among community members, they are empowered to maximize that value by focusing scarce resources on the greatest opportunities for improvement. By doing this, they help foster genuine loyalty and deeper engagement among community members, which helps generate growth and development that creates even more value for the region."

Using real-world examples, the article describes what happens when senior executives are lulled into complacency, causing them to turn a blind eye to emerging opportunities to drive sustainable revenue. In particular, the article profiles how other companies have successfully adapted. What constitutes value for customers is ephemeral, adding risk to corporate strategies. Yesterday's cash cow can become today's obsolete product. Leaders must continually define what ‘prospective customer’ means in the context of their industry. They must figure out which products to develop and sell. They must learn how customers intend to buy what they and their competitors, produce. But not every executive fully understands the grave importance for solving these problems. In just five years, revenue sources for most companies will be quite different from the ones they depend on today, and some will not make the transition. There are no ordained roadmaps for addressing boundary risk, but cited in the article are tactics common to the successful companies: acknowledging the risks, having adequate financial capacity to absorb failure and fostering a culture that accepts those outcomes, along with successes."

And given the number one reason for customers leaving a business is a feeling of indifference from a company representative, this is an area that holds a great opportunity for companies to really stand out from their competition. This article examines where business has come from, where we are now and why the critical need to revamp our way of thinking. When a company transforms into a customer-centric organization, a collective mindset to design for the desired outcome of customer emotion emerges. The context for thought is creating value for the customer and is expressed in changes to processes, products/services and people. When an employee transforms into being customer focused, the individual mindset of paying attention to how he leaves a person feeling begins to develop. This shift from task to the customer lays the foundation for developing human connection skills. Customer value creation becomes a common language of understanding with different expressions of it for company and individuals. The reader will discover why traditional soft skills training has failed to bring about lasting behaviour changes and offers an alternative, based on the insights provided in recent years from neuroscience."

Much of that innovation is being driven by the Internet, which has become a global platform for innovation and engagement. Through it we can connect people, processes, data, systems and devices faster, more effectively and more powerfully and innovate faster because of it than at any time in history. That capability and the innovation it enables are rapidly changing what customers value and are blurring the boundaries between how we create products and services as well as companies, and how we engage customers. Those changes are leading us into a market composed of digital ecosystems and intelligent products that anticipate and facilitate high-value customer/user outcomes based on the users context. To compete in the digitally transformed future will require not just understanding the technology, but also being immersed in the cultures creating it, and working collaboratively with customers and other participants in the digital ecosystems to identify and create new breakthrough value. For products and services to be competitive they must be highly personalized for users and contextualized based on their location and needs at the moment. Transforming your company into an organization that can compete and lead in that future is critical to your success. It requires a top-down commitment from your most senior executives. And it requires working collaboratively with your most visionary customers and partners to create a digital vision and a continually adaptive strategy and transformation plan. This article provides a series of questions and recommended action items to help you develop that vision and strategy and to help you become a vibrant part of that digital future."

However, many products do not include features within the design of the product that enable a continuing stream of interactions. This is not due to inferior work by design engineers. Rather, most requirements provided to development teams are product-centric and do not address the relationship interactions that occur between the seller and customer. There are no requirements for creating or enabling a steady stream of customer interactions. Development teams create designs based upon the requirements they are given. Product-development methodologies restrict the development teams so that the designs they create do not include features that are not found in the design requirements. Transforming design requirements to include these features will lead to a dimension of customer value creation that can be operationally managed for competitive advantage."

It adopted more tools, applications and data than ever before. It is not unusual to see marketing teams use 70 software applications and publish hundreds of messages daily. By their nature, digital marketers interact with millions of customers and prospects daily. Their work shapes customers’ and prospects’ perceptions of your products and services. In the Internet era, they are your frontline employees. But recent studies point to a troubling gap: digital marketers believe their companies are only 34 per cent proficient (effective) at digital marketing. Which chief executive officer (CEO) would want efficiency if that creates a frontline function that, by its own account, is effective less than 50 per cent of the time? Just like a CEO would work with their service, sales or manufacturing functions to improve effectiveness, they must also work with their chief marketing officer (CMO’s) to improve digital marketing’s effectiveness. To do this, a CEO must understand digital marketing’s levers, what does a best-in-class organization do and the steps their organization can take to become more effective."

The work of Jean Baudrillard is referenced to help explain some of the complexity around buying value perceptions and decisions. A four-step process is outlined to help readers develop value assessments in a business context: (a) Value Hypotheses; (b) Sources of Value Flowcharts; (c) Value Word Equations; and (d) Value Models. An established means used by medics to evaluate pain is referenced to demonstrate the measurement of intangible factors.

This article describes the essential part of a solution which is adoption of a new fourth generation of innovation management (4G) to emerge as best practice since 1900. 4G effectively enables radical innovation. Radical innovation is required for sustained, adequate rates of economic growth driven by improvements in productivity, quality and cost in industries such as health care, education, construction and energy. As a result of inadequate radical innovation for decades, a group of major economic, social and environmental wicked problems , such as, income inequality and global warming, remain unsolved, and these problems exist in all countries including the United States. In his landmark book Capital in the Twenty-first Century, Thomas Piketty linked inadequate economic growth to income inequality. A distinguished economist and professor at Northwestern University, Robert Gordon, has identified the current global situation as a period of potentially permanently stalled economic growth unless value creation driven by radical innovation is resumed at a level and with rates similar to what occurred in the three industrial/information revolutions since 1750. Since 1900, there have been three separate and successive periods of time in which a new generation of innovation management was created and then adopted as best practice to replace, augment and improve the practices in earlier generations. The root cause of the global problem is that none of the three generations have been effective in creating an adequate amount of radical innovation which requires a new dominant design to transform (a) capabilities in organizations based on knowledge, tools (which include purchased products and services), technology and processes, (b) business models and (c) the structure of markets and industries. 4G is guided by 12 new principles and practices to effectively and efficiently create radical innovation based on new dominant designs while also improving the efficient creation of incremental innovation. Part 1 of this article describes 4G and the first four principles of 4G in detail. Another companion article, Part 2, will later describe the remaining eight principles in detail as essential part of a solution."

We will see how the use of new technologies influenced consumers’ expectations and behaviour and how/why it could emphasize their search for greater (and new) value. We want to point out that although it may be obvious that channel consistency is now a necessity, it cannot consist solely on ‘window dressing’ but also requires an entire customer focus among all services of companies. In this perspective, we will question why customer relationship management (CRM) alone cannot be the answer. Although research has shown for some time, now that fully cross-functional organizations and involvement of all stakeholders in the companies’ value creation is a key for success, many companies are still struggling to achieve an appropriate integration and remain silo based. Finally, it is our intention to raise awareness that value creation is not just for customers. It can only be truly successful when that value is also created for, with and by all company employees. This is the challenge of traditionally silo-organized enterprises, with their competing or overlapping roles and responsibilities. It, thus, becomes imperative that organizations evolve towards more cross-functional activities, with the full involvement of all stakeholders in the value chain."

Following Sharia traditions, Islamic banking is more concerned with socio-economic values, such as well-being, trust, ethics and partnership than with economic values, such as money in terms of interest. To investigate the unique value, service system and value proposition in Islamic banking, we combined the results from literature review, press releases and interviews. The literature review showed that the Islamic banks ensure secure investments and profit or loss sharing. The press releases on banking websites showed that Islamic banking focuses on socio-economic values rather than economic values. The interview analysis showed that Islamic banking is mostly focused on justice and transparency of projects, achieved under the benevolent watch of the Sharia board, over all banking activities. These findings reveal that the backbone of value co-creation in Islamic banking is contract-based projects which create economic opportunities and social experiences, and ensure that in Islamic banks, values create value for the customer. This concept is typically seen even in modern services."

The first article described the essential part of a solution which is adoption of a new fourth generation of innovation management (4G) which has emerged as best practice since 2000 because 4G effectively enables radical innovation in addition to more effective and efficient incremental innovation. Radical innovation is required for sustained, adequate rates of economic growth driven by improvements in productivity, quality and cost in industries such as healthcare, education, construction and energy. As a result of inadequate radical innovation over the past four decades, a group of major economic, social and environmental wicked problems are unsolved such as income inequality and global warming and these problems exist in all countries including the United States. 4G is guided by 12 new principles and practices to effectively and efficiently create radical innovation based on new dominant designs while also improving the efficient creation of incremental innovation. The first article, Part 1, described the first four principles of 4G in detail. This article, Part 2, describes the remaining eight principles of 4G in detail."

This article examines why that is the case. It starts with the premise that the CEO is smart and perceives higher priorities or tasks than the Customer priority, which explains the lack of change in organizations. Since the CEO feels his/her current priorities are successful, there is no pressure to change. It suggests that consultants and advisors are not able to convince the CEO that there are better (Customer-centric) options. In other words, the lack of organizational change is due to the fact that consultants fail to make a strong enough case for change. This article then helps the advisor develop arguments about tasks versus priorities and the effective use of time (if the lack of time is used as an excuse) in order to assist them in making the case for change. Another problem is that these advisors confuse the executives with various Customer terms and portray their terms as the only way to success, be they Customer experience (CX), Customer journey, Customer value, Customer effort, etc. This article goes on to show what Customer-Centric and Customer value creation ideas the CEO should use in order to facilitate change. It shows how Customer priority can change and what is the impact of that change. A complete and revolutionary transformation of the company is required to make it Customer-Centric."

Customers no longer stay satisfied for long. They are looking to be surprised and delighted by most, if not all, of the products and services they buy. Today’s challenge is to find ways to better and more quickly satisfy these ever-increasing demands of our customers. Adopting the three highly effective habits laid out in this article provide a clear roadmap. These include setting stretch targets for every new launch, regular connection with and observation of customers, and the expansion of idea generation to greater input from both internal and external sources. These are the three essential elements that make innovation of increased value to both customers and companies. Customers get more of what they want, need and sometimes what they have only dreamed of having. Organizations see greater loyalty and satisfaction, easier acceptance of price increases and a better understanding of both the current market and the future potential of new categories. In summary, this article shows that successful innovation and creating shared value go hand-in-hand in today’s connected world."

Design/methodology/approach – A survey of 642 credit union (CU) members from nine geographically dispersed USA CUs was conducted. WAR analysis was conducted to measure the relative value customers place on the selected variables within and across the financial institutions that were part of the borrowers’ consideration sets. Findings – WAR analysis revealed stark differences in the value of factors in the selection of a bank or a credit union for first mortgages, suggesting that WAR analysis is a useful tool for understanding the relative value of various attributes in the selection of one loan provider over another. Originality/value –This research provides a significant contribution to both the service literature and the scientific literature in general by providing a user-friendly and scientifically tested analysis tool to measure relative value distances of ranked data and providing additional evidence for the usefulness of WAR analysis to better understand relative customer satisfaction and its implications for consumer behavior and service marketing."

This study explores and prioritizes drivers enabling value co-creation from the perspectives of client and service provider in the context of IT-services outsourcing. An extensive literature review and subsequent pilot study suggest six probable value drivers that are further, statistically validated and prioritized. The unit of analysis is front-line professionals, working with either party. A web-based survey was administered to collect data from 256 respondents, drawn using judgemental sampling. Strategic Intent and Service Actualization are found to be significant and common value drivers for both parties (client and service provider), though with different priorities. The other significant value drivers are found to be Collective Capabilities for client and Intrapreneurship for service provider (these value drivers are not common to the client and service provider). This study reiterates and crystallizes the understanding of value co-creation process in the context of IT-services outsourcing. The identified drivers would enable practitioners to understand and to reconcile the drivers for client(s) and service provider(s) in order to realize the respective value outcome. The commonality of two value drivers; strategic intent and service actualization for both clients and service providers indicates the opportunity for co-creation of value."

Moreover, the whole view of value formation has undergone a shift of paradigms from provider-centric to customer-centric. In parallel to these changes, the theory of experience economy has emerged. Even though the researchers of various schools have been contributing a significant effort to conceptualize service value, the experiential dimension of value has remained unexplored. Current research aims to identify and describe the concept of value in the service-dominant economy, where the role of experience cannot be underestimated. This article presents the results of a comparative review of the literature on service value formation from the perspectives of service value and experience economy domains of marketing literature. As a result of this analysis, we present the concept of value-in-experience, which continues the evolution of value and includes service experience as an element of service value formation."

However, recent developments in value creation call for a reconceptualization of the value theory—in terms of how it applies to subjective values, organizational behaviour and economic activity. This article argues that although there is much literature announcing a pendulum shift towards value in use, there is a lack of an adequate explanation of how to resolve the long-standing discrepancy in the value theories. In addition, the literature heralding the new value concept is inadequate in explicating it in terms most useful to practitioner—how it can be applied as a theoretical model for improving performance. This article adds to the body of literature heralding the new value concept and its potential for improving organizational and social economic performances by explaining the factors connected with the value creation concept that make it an effective multidimensional strategy for integrating the economic resources of society to create increased benefit for all stakeholders plus by explaining how the value creation concept can be developed into an integrative theoretical business strategy and/or model."

Microenterprises financing through microfinance institutions are playing a pivotal role in creating employment opportunities for their target households. This study observes the impact of Islamic microfinance on self, family and community employment generation activities. In this regard, data were collected from 168 clients of three pioneering Islamic microfinance institutions working in Lahore, Pakistan. The study uses descriptive analysis and probability econometric modeling to achieve its objectives. The results show that the Islamic microfinance played a significant role in starting and extending existing businesses of the target households. Moreover, it also helps households and community members to get absorbed in the microenterprises apart from borrowers themselves. Therefore, it is concluded that Islamic microfinance does go beyond self-employability."

Companies have reacted to this trend by integrating customers into product development processes in an effort to better fulfil their needs and simultaneously decrease costs. While research has explored various antecedents and consequences of such co-creation activities, only little is known about the psychological ownership’s role and its interaction with peer feedback. This research shows that psychological ownership emerges when customers engage with companies in creating the product portfolio. Furthermore, implementing feedback loops accelerates customer engagement’s positive effects in terms of product evaluations and customers’ willingness to pay. Negative feedback reverses these effects suggesting that companies should pay closer attention to feedback options when integrating customers into value creation processes."

If used, the matrix would promote more effective facilitation and management of joint ideational creativity at the M–R interface. The matrix itself is based, and justified, on the premise that managing ideation processes more effectively is a necessary precursor to any supply chain or supply chain’s partnership’s ability to create superior value. The matrix features 10 methods designed to facilitate both ‘divergent’ and ‘convergent’ creative activities. The ability to facilitate divergent thinking should promote the development of greater numbers of highly creative M–R ideas. The ability to engage successfully in convergent thinking should further ensure that only the most useful new ideas are developed. At net, greater creativity will result at any point within any supply chain setting where the human representatives ‘intersect and interact’ for purposes of addressing pressing problems or jointly pursuing attractive opportunities and creating value."

It is argued that there is a need to uncover what is inherent in the prefix ‘co’ in value co-creation and that focus needs to be broadened, from perception of value to the production of value, that is, the specific reciprocal and embodied actions in service encounters. For the analysis, an empirical study of complex interactions between service providers and customers is used. A practice approach is applied, combining interviews and observations of interactants in situ. The article identifies four specific turn-taking patterns, ranging from ‘simple’ to ‘elaborated’, defined by their character and that uncover how the interactants reciprocally use multiple modes in the production of social outcomes. Theoretically, the study contributes to more fine-grained explanations to what explains the creation (and destruction) of value."

However, models are missing that link existing research on value creation and apply it in a concrete service marketing business context. This article explores how value-in-use must be enabled before entering the relational business solution creation process. Drawing from extant literature, the authors develop a conceptual model with four interrelated elements—solution objectives, resource requirements, assessment and customer–provider interaction. These elements must be aligned iteratively to enable value-in-use. The current study integrates the proposed model into the overarching context of the solution process that culminates with experienced value-in-use.

The literature suggests that multichannel integration quality allows firms to benefit from the effect of synergy and complementarity between channels. We investigate the perceived value of multichannel service delivery in the context of retail banking services, where such multichannel systems are omnipresent. We propose and test a model in which multichannel integration quality is an important value driver, such that higher multichannel integration quality leads to greater value perceptions of not only the multichannel system, but also the overall value of the bank as perceived by the customer. Importantly, the complexity of the multichannel system of service delivery, as perceived by customers, moderates the direct effect of channel integration quality on perceived value of the multichannel system, so that in highly complex multichannel systems, channel integration quality will have a stronger effect on the perceived value to customer. Our findings also shed light on the specific factors that contribute to consumer value perceptions of multichannel retail banking services, which has important implications to managers and researchers."

The extant literature primarily focused on tangible value in firm context, relegating value created in an individual’s personal space. CCV extends beyond tangible outcomes. While service-dominant logic (SDL) created more interest in co-creation, much of the literature remained at a conceptual level. Empirical studies centred on the individual CCV are scarce. This article argues that individuals co-create value in their own space and there is a need to recognize and enhance our knowledge about it. The article proposes a conceptual model for individuals’ CCV in mobile health (mHealth) service context, identifying knowledge, well-being and productivity as dimensions that define quality of life. The study yields insights on how individuals generate value through the use of technology. The study contributes new knowledge on factors that contribute to individuals’ CCV. For value research and theory, the article positions individuals at the centre over firms. The research extends value envelope beyond firms and tangible outcomes to encompass individuals and experiential value. For Information Systems (IS), the model expands study horizon to complex social settings that yield valuable insights on how socio-technical interactions alter individual’s CCV. The study may further motivate empirical work on individual’s CCV."

Despite its central importance, debate still exists as to what value entails. Absent a comprehensive understanding of value, researchers and managers have grappled with how to measure and manage value. Not surprisingly, absent a definition, no comprehensive, robust approach has emerged. We argue that value first must be viewed as a dual construct, i.e. value to the customer and value to the firm, that must be balanced to be sustainable. Given that value to the customer is clearly assessed as relative to competitive alternatives, we also argue that any robust measurement of value must account for competitive alternatives. We propose applying recent research on the use of relative metrics in linking to share of category spending as the foundation of assessing value to the customer (particularly since customers in most categories divide their spending across competing firms). This allows firms to assess the monetary value customers’ assign to their offerings, and to estimate changes in this value from different market actions. As value to the firm is ultimately about the net present value of customers’ economic contributions to the firm, this allows firms to balance value to the customer with value to the firm."

To support customers to be able and willing to pay this value, a customized, quantified business case needs to be developed to allow the customer to see the payback for whatever investment is being requested versus other alternatives. A previous methodology to do this was to look at the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the proposed purchase over its life. However, too often, TCO became the total cost of acquisition by procurement people (missing the installation, operational and disposal phases, which is often 8 times more important than the landed cost). The next evolution is to look at a more holistic measurement of value that takes into account not only cost savings but all improvements, such as risk reductions, increased revenue and customer satisfaction. Only then can buyers and sellers make decisions on who is creating the best value and what someone should be willing to pay for it. Anyone who can demonstrate and document the greatest value surplus is the one delivering the best value."

More research on this topic is thus needed, especially in the rapidly growing context of ecosystems that make the analysis of value co-creation and value co-destruction even more complex.

The typology is based on whether both benefits and costs exist in the same time dimension or if one of them occurs before another."

Seen from above, they lack a microfoundation. In the present article, value and value creation are discussed from a micro position, based on a service logic (SL) analysis of the service perspective on business and marketing. In the Grönroos-Voima value model of SL, only one value concept—value-in-use—is used, to support theoretical rigour. The customer not only determines value, but is also the value creator. By facilitating customers’ value creation, the firm provides potential value, which evolves as value-in-use during use or consumption. If the actors can establish a platform of co-creation during direct interactions, the service provider’s and the customer’s processes merge into one interactive, collaborative and dialogical process, and then the firm may co-create value with the customer. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

There is a confusion in the term itself but also in the sequence of creating, quantifying, and capturing value. This article intends to clarify the difference between the three steps of customer value management. It posits that customer value management needs to be a formal process in organizations and that this process needs to be formally managed as well. In order to do so, organizations need to focus on the development of customer value management capabilities across the three stages of the customer value management process: creation, quantification, and capture. Customer value is not just created. It needs to be managed."

This article builds on a rich tradition in economics to untangle some of the ambiguities surrounding these concepts. First, it is argued that a rigorous approach to analyzing value must be based on a subjectivist notion of value related to the perceived needs and preferences of consumers. Second, it is suggested that the value-price-cost (VPC) framework in economics may constitute an effective, yet simple, model for understanding how value is created and appropriated by different actors. Third, it is argued that multilevel issues related to buyer-supplier relationships, stakeholder management and the formation of firms should be addressed using a symmetrical model that allows for freeform bargaining between the involved actors.

Value and value creation are natural to and basic in human behaviour and endeavour, and should be at the centre of our attention. Actors 1 1 Actors are people or institutions. In this article, we will refer to actors as him or himself (which incudes it and itself, them and themselves) for convenience. Actors often interact with other actors. (whether individuals or institutions) in the global ecosystem strive for value for themselves and their constituents. This article proposes a holistic value dominant logic (VDL) that exists universally and encompasses what happens during, before and after (outside) the business and social ecosystem. VDL looks at the needs perspective of the actors and the results of the actors. VDL describes value waiting to happen, how it can be recognized and developed (and its role is creativity and innovation) and how to prevent value destruction. Value, though considered important, has remained a result of the process in service exchange, with no major push on measurements and on conscious value creation. This article aims to put a bigger focus on value and its creation. VDL is based on a global ecosystem; on understanding what value is and how it is embedded in the ecosystem and how it impacts business and society, and beyond. Value addition and value creation are delineated. Eight principles of VDL are enunciated."

The latter has exerted particular influence in economic and business thought since the time of Adam Smith. However, several value-related research streams have, more recently, drawn attention to the contextual and experiential nature of value creation and determination, shifting primary attention to the importance of value-in-use. The convergence of these streams can be seen in the transcending conceptual framework of service-dominant (S-D) logic and its service-ecosystem perspective. Despite its origination in marketing, S-D logic increasingly represents an interdisciplinary endeavour. This commentary elaborates S-D logic’s conceptualization of value—‘a change in the viability of a system’—by capturing the nature of value through four propositions: (1) value is phenomenological, (2) value is always co-created, (3) value is multidimensional and (4) value is emergent. It also provides some specific suggestions for how future scholarly work can contribute to the further refinement of the understanding of value."

Therefore, negotiators have to go out of the box to satisfy all parties, that is, create value by expanding the negotiation pie. The purpose of this research study is to identify the preference of Pakistani and Chinese officials, who are working together on Neelum–Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (NJHEP), with respect to endorsement of different negotiation styles, that is, knowing their preferences for ‘value creation’ or ‘value claiming’. It also explores differences (if any) between managers of two nationalities with respect to opting certain negotiating strategies in their pursuit of value creation for their customers and stakeholders. Hence, it answers the core question: Do negotiation styles vary from one nation to other in a multicultural work setting? A sample of 303 managers (Pakistani managers = 153 and Chinese managers = 150) was extracted by using convenient sampling technique. Respondents were surveyed via close-ended questionnaire through emails and in person. Mean analysis was used to identify the dominant negotiation style of each nationality and t -test was applied to test the prevalence of hypothetical differences between Pakistani and Chinese officials concerning their choice of negotiation strategies. Chinese managers dominantly use competing negotiation style while negotiating with their Pakistani counterparts. In their negotiation style preference ranking, competing, collaborating, accommodating, compromising and avoiding style stood at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th ranks, respectively. It means that, first they attempt to claim maximum value, if they fail to do so, they opt ‘value creation’ as their residual strategy, which requires proactive, conscious and imaginative actions. On the other hand, Pakistani managers excessively use accommodating style while negotiating with their Chinese counterparts. In their preference ranking, accommodating, compromising, collaborating, avoiding and competing style stood 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th, respectively. Here, it appears that Pakistani managers are ‘depleting the value’ by simply forgoing their interests instead of looking for a win–win situation. In fact, they are also creating value in a novel manner for their stakeholders (government and people of Pakistan) by accommodating foreign investors (Chinese), who are making hefty investments in their country. There is a significant difference between the approach of Pakistani and Chinese managers to create value during negotiations. This is the first study which unveils the negotiation style of Pakistani managers, particularly when they are negotiating with foreigners. Similarly, it reveals the negotiating style of the Chinese managers while negotiating with their Pakistani counterparts and on a foreign land. Understanding of negotiation styles of people will add value to all cross-cultural negotiation situations, particularly of those which are developed during implementation of projects under the umbrella of Pak-China Economic Corridor. It highlights the importance of cultural intelligence and sensitivity in multicultural negotiations and demands for managerial training on the subject."

As a result, they might perceive the same products as less valuable. While past research has investigated numerous ways of reducing the negative effect of perceived product risk on customers’ perceived value, surprisingly, the role of brand trust has not been taken into account. This article aims to fill this gap by investigating how consumers’ trust in a brand, as well as their trusting beliefs about the brand’s competence, benevolence and integrity, may moderate the relationship between consumers’ perceived product risk and consumers’ perceived value. By means of two empirical studies based on a panel of smartphone users, the authors propose and demonstrate that the trust customers have for a brand can mitigate the negative effect of perceived product risk on perceived value of products with the same brand name. Importantly, findings also show that the various beliefs underlying trust have differential downstream effects. More specifically, while benevolence and integrity beliefs about a brand mitigate the negative effect of perceived product risk on customers’ perceived value, competence beliefs were found irrelevant to the effect of risk on value. These findings inform and guide marketing practitioners’ efforts to cultivate specific, rather than generic, trusting beliefs to ultimately create and maximize value for their customers who otherwise view these products as risky."

Heskett, Sasser and Schlesinger (2003, The value profit chain . New York, NY: The Free Press) argued that customer value is created by satisfied, productive and loyal employees. This indicates that the company must first provide value to employees. What has not sufficiently been analysed is how to and who should provide value to employees. We verified that not only the company provides value through its policies or systems, but also through those managers who lead at middle level. They play an essential role in creating value for employees when guiding them consistently through specific behaviours that promote value for customers. Our research has focused on developing specific middle managers’ behaviours in order to create a climate focused on service that contributes to enhancing employee value in the commercial unit of a leading insurance company in Peru. The literature explains the need of a generic climate (GC) as a foundation for focused climates, but it has not been demonstrated how to link these climates through the leadership of middle managers. We applied a model of service leadership that facilitates this link, emphasizes excellence in service and enhances employees’ value."

The findings of the study show that the critical attributes of boardroom diversity are members’ culture/nationality, functional background and gender diversity. Value-creating boards also have evolved processes, such as an objective nomination process, periodic evaluations of the board and its members and their ability to work as a team. The article contributes to the Strategic Leadership theory and other role-effectiveness theories. It makes a significant contribution to existing literature on board diversity and value creation by suggesting that board diversity needs a broader definition—more than mere demographic attributes of directors and board processes—to improve boards’ ability to create value for organizations. The article also contributes to praxis by presenting evidence of the impact of board diversity on value creations and suggesting the most critical aspects of value-creating boards. The findings may also guide the formulation of legislation for improving corporate governance by defining diversity more broadly."

However, a new way of looking at things has started to even out the balance. In this article, we will discuss both sides of the debate, state the underlying problem at the base of the debate, and give examples of how this debate actually destroys value. In most cases, this failure is not really a failure, but was designed into the system by misguided managerial choices. We then present our solution based on thinking holistically about productivity and efficiency in a world of co-creation, and discuss ways for managers to implement it in their organizations. This implementation is based on current examples from the literature, as well as a discussion as to why these ways are so effective. In a sense, in a world of co-creation, efficiency becomes less important, as the customer is willing to pay more money for a higher value product, thus covering the cost of a slightly less efficient process."

Design/methodology/approach – The authors examine the responses of 554 recent purchasers and 598 intended purchasers of smartphones about the features of smartphones that they have considered/will consider in their purchase decisions and the relative value they assign to each feature. MaxDiff, ACBC, constant sum scaling and WAR are used for quantifying the importance of these features and correlation analysis is used to compare the results of the four methods. Findings – The authors find that constant sum scaling and WAR provide nearly identical results at both the aggregate and individual levels, while MaxDiff and ACBC produce similar results to WAR at the aggregate level only. Originality/value – This research validates the feasibility of a simple method for estimating the utility of product features by demonstrating the similarity of results to more established and/or complex methods.

The present exploratory research aims to demonstrate the value of customer references from the perspective of the potential customer. This goal will be achieved by considering a single case study that provides evidence for the value of customer references to potential customers in business markets. Three theoretical propositions emerge as key conceptual contributions: (a) customer references allow buying companies to establish their suppliers’ competence, assess the buying decision risk and forecast return on investment; (b) customer references deliver value by helping potential customers to identify new business needs and (c) potential customers benefit from being exposed to customer references insofar as they are sources of organizational learning.

In service economies, almost any activity, asset, and skill can be bought on competitive markets, making it harder to build competitive advantage on any of those inputs. Against that background, the question emerges what constitutes sustainable value propositions of service providers. Drawing on an emerging stream of research on the non-ownership value of services, we argue that service providers create value by taking on ownership of service assets and thereby transform uncertainty of value creation into economic opportunities. In our view, service providers offer the essential value proposition of transforming their clients’ uncertainty downsides into opportunities related to assets such as vehicles, real estate, equipment and computing platforms. Clients benefit by delegating ownership of assets to the domain of a service provider. In turn, clients can focus their investment on their most promising assets. Service providers create sustainable competitive advantage by assuming ownership and excelling at the management of (a) unique physical assets, (b) unique intangible assets and (c) maintaining an appropriate architecture of social capital through customer relationships and business ecosystems."

Methodology— Qualitative research was undertaken to deeply investigate and explore the value co-created through people’s interactions with CAs. A total of 32 interviews were conducted in three phases. The interview data were analysed using MAXQDA 12. Results— The results of this study indicate that most of the users use Apple’s Siri, Amazon Eco or Google Home as their CAs and that people’s interactions with CAs are influenced by their trust in and relative advantages of using CAs. The results also indicate that a diversity of value, such as enhanced communication, better task management, enhanced information retrieval, enhanced learning and better data-driven decisions, is co-created through interactions between people and CAs. Implications— We developed a service-system framework in which CAs are considered as actors and introduced the concept of ‘autonomous agency’ for controlling and coordinating people’s interactions with CAs.

As business platforms do not ‘produce’ products or services, they represent a new model of value creation that raises the question about the core nature of a firm in the twenty-first century, when ‘data is the new oil’. At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of ‘value chains, value shops and value networks’ represented the latest development about internal value creation in a firm, but lacked any discussion about information technology (IT) or even ‘data as raw material’. This digital approach to monetarize aggregated data sets as internal core function of a firm needs more clarification, as value creation ‘without production’ is a shift of paradigm. This article starts with the concept of ‘value chains, value shops and value networks’, extends this to current IT and includes business platforms within an integrated framework of internal value creation in a firm. Based on this framework and the current development of leading-edge artificial intelligence (AI), this framework is applied to forecast the development towards ‘AI-enabled data platforms’, which are not covered by traditional economic theories. This article calls for more research to clarify the impact of such data-based business models compared to production-based models."

A business model may allow for capturing value or losing it through inconsistency. It can capture value from customers and other stakeholders, such as investors. If a business model is consistent, then stakeholders believe in it and it attracts value.

The first is to get practitioners and academics understand the value of a value destruction focus. How can it improve value creation? This is a brand new area that has not hitherto received much attention. The second is to get practitioners to use this thinking more actively in building their strategy, operational thinking, compliance thought process and regulatory and political (environmental and external) thinking. The third is to open up a new area of research for academics who work on various subjects where value creation is a goal or is important. Perhaps they can analyse past failures and come up with recipes for greater value creation and a process for analysis before committing to a path of action or they can find better processes for looking at, designing, developing or monitoring strategy, new products and services, new technologies and new operational thinking. What new tools can be developed to analyse or mitigate value destruction or simply foresee these? This should also open a debate and papers in Journal of Creating Value and perhaps lead to a special issue. What techniques can be used to change managerial mind-sets. Finally and fourth, the aim is to get away from reactive and ‘after-the-fact’ analysis to proactive value creation and reduce value destruction and learn from value destruction potential."

An organization’s ability to disseminate accurate, complete and timely information has been related to higher levels of organizational efficiencies, in turn generating value for customers. An assumption underlying this conceptual article is that organizations capable of sharing information efficiently and effectively have created certain social–technical conditions that make the interaction of stakeholders more fluid and productive, reducing cycling time of the decision-making process. This article will propose how such an information sharing infrastructure may be conceptualized as a boundary object, providing common mechanisms and meanings for all actors involved in moving data and transforming it into knowledge. With these conditions set, we identify that an enabler of value—the human capability to transform data into information and knowledge—can be created, and organizational benefits can be realized in the form of efficient and accurate decision-making."

Notions of culture change, the role and purpose of business, flexibility, resilience, the nature of leadership, the employment relationship and talent are themselves embedded in this macro context and in need of revision. The range of working practices and related values associated with Agile, and the changing expectations of workers and customers, suggests that new approaches to leadership and change management are needed. Attempts to scale up Agile to an enterprise level generally meet with little success typically due to cultural barriers, with conventional leadership approaches, linear thinking and mechanistic change management being particular stumbling blocks. It is often assumed that, as people engage and start using agile methodologies, they will feel committed to sustain the benefits of agility, including innovation. However, tackling only one aspect of cultural change is unlikely to produce lasting value. The article suggests various ways in which organizational cultures, leadership behaviours and change management practices may need to shift to deliver sustainable value through a better balance of organizational and employee needs. The role of senior leaders in committing to, and enabling these shifts, is pivotal."

But cases on agility for non-profit associations dealing with a multitude of members, geographies and their own boards are scarce. Can agility also be applied in a non-profit networked organizational setting in a way that creates value, rather than destroying it? The focus of this article will be on the outcomes of piloting agility with a virtual long-distance team across Europe, including benefits and pitfalls. Value should be created through virtual teams of the association: both for the benefit of members and the association itself. If there is no or little value created there, the members will be unlikely to participate in these groups, undermining the added value of the association. Currently, these teams do not all create value for the membership, and sometimes even destroy value by costing the membership time and money and not delivering relevant output. In this pilot study, one virtual group was followed, interviews with the group members have been held and the members of the association were surveyed about the existing situation in the focal organization. We found that an agile way of working is beneficial for a virtual team and implementing this in an ailing virtual team can give it new élan. This way, the teams can deliver value to the membership, and thus to the association, instead of the groups not functioning well leading to value destruction for the association, as members might turn away from the association for their sought added value. Further, the network organization itself partially shows traits of organizational agility, which could be improved to fully support virtual teams."

Managers tried to categorize well-known problems into boxes with strategy labels, the top of a firm’s agenda was steering clear of potential potholes, and there was a choice between clear-cut future options. These strategies no longer work today, and just repeating what we have been done before is not a convincing recipe. The world has become different with multiple and often fuzzy options. In this article, we suggest that companies in different industries have to become more agile. Naturally, agility is not easy to implement as managers fear chaos and confusion. Thus, we introduce agility patterns with different degrees of change. For instance, high-reliability organizations, such as transportation or nuclear energy, are supposed to engage more in gradual change and stick closer to planning. However, we argue that even these companies have to become agile, albeit on a different level. In contrast, companies that exhibit lower system relevance, such as advertising or arts, may strive for agility that involves transformational elements; they can engage in experimentation and play and are more likely to accept inherent chaos in their change strategy. We use the notion of agility patterns for these different degrees of change and show how they help to mitigate the risks that come from either inertia (as a result of linear planning) or experiential chaos (as a result of full agile transformation). Depending on the industry and the degree of change, we distinguish between resilient, versatile and transformational agility patterns. We illustrate each category with examples and highlight how agility patterns can be applied to create value."

Yet, executives and academics alike agree that the current level of agility in the vast majority of companies is not nearly what it needs to be. To develop a level of organizational agility suited to turbulent environmental conditions, executives need to place an emphasis on three areas: strategic agility, operational agility (including culture as well as structures and systems), and leadership agility. This article highlights the central role that leadership agility plays in creating agile organizations, and it presents a framework for understanding and developing leadership agility."

However, many companies that adopt Agile principles soon experience early indicators of struggle, such as starting development before the value to the end user is fully understood or delivering products that are not done. These problems limit the ability of organizations to create value for both their end users and the company. The purpose of this article is to share our experience as practitioners on a range of Agile development practices from a value-driven perspective. Common blind spots are highlighted and the value-driven principles that enable development teams to sustainably create value are explained. Our experimentation with various improvement approaches has provided insight into value-driven principles and the framework that interconnects these principles. This article describes the value-driven framework (VDF) as a methodology developed by practitioners for businesses that struggle to enable their workforce to increase the value of their products. The VDF provides an approach to overcome these struggles in a four-step process: (1) explore to find opportunity, (2) discover the most valuable next step, (3) experiment to try-out and learn, and (4) value will emerge as a sustainable user benefit."

To deliver on these opportunities, marketing has become a means by which organizations across the product-service spectrum directly interact with customers outside of traditional value-creating activities. Via social media, organizations influence customers while supporting value co-creation for the brand and users simultaneously. While this offers a wide range of opportunities to interact with customers, continued saturation of social networks has magnified the importance of engaging in organic dialogue. To that end, the aim of this article is to establish a framework usable across industries, platforms and content types. The social media value creation framework includes six vertical categories, including respond, transact, educate, awareness, stimulate and entertain. Definitions and examples of each vertical, along with theoretical and practical applications, are included."

It examines a key period during which ING Bank has attempted to transform itself from a traditional bank to a ‘platform bank’ with the help of both benchmarked and ad hoc agile methods and mindset. The research is extensively based on a review of the agile methods and creating value literature, semi-structured interviews of the key ING Group and ING Netherlands stakeholders, a documentary review of existing literature on ING’s transformation, ING public information (annual reports, special reports, marketing materials) as well as ING internal documents (presentations, internal documents, training materials, etc.). To ensure multi-layered coverage of the full story, interviewees were chosen to capture the points of view of key participants in the transformation journey and who represent the full range of major internal stakeholders, namely representatives from IT, Business, HR and Corporate. The aim of this case study is to gain a more granular understanding of the key factors, people, processes and insights that helped drive ING’s profound transformation of its operations, management, strategy and vision and how this ongoing ‘agile transformation’ is value accretive (or not) for ING and its stakeholders. The article identifies the three stages of a successful agile transformation as well as the underlying paradox for an organization to remain agile over time and at scale."

This article builds on the original concept of the ‘Cone of Uncertainty’ for costs. However, the focus of an organization should mainly be on value. To visualize value, the concept of a ‘Double Cone of Uncertainty’ is introduced. Organizations often focus on reducing costs instead of enhancing the creation of value because costs are easier to measure and in control of the organization. Value is harder to measure, and here the customer is in charge. In addition, value creation lies further in the future. The article shows, with IT development as an example, how organizational agility and emergent product development can enhance the predictability of costs by time-boxing with stable, multidisciplinary teams. Although organizational agility cannot enhance the predictability of value, it can enhance the probability of value with emergent product development and quick and frequent feedback from customers. This evolutionary process of trial and error is essential in complicated and complex fast-changing environments."
